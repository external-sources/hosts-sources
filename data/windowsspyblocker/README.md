## About

**WindowsSpyBlocker** :shield: is an application written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and delivered as
a [single executable](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/releases/latest) to block spying and
tracking on Windows systems.

The approach of this project is to capture and interpret network traffic based on a set of tools. Depending on the
interactions between services and source or destination of traffic, rules are created and sorted by assignment.
